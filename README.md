# Ansible Collection - jjaswanson4.utilities

This is a collection of highly opinionated, purpose driven ansible roles and tools that I use frequently. The intention is to cut down on the amount of duplicate code and instead defer to roles that take inputs from a vars source.

### Roles
This collection contains the following roles:
- idm_dns_records: manages DNS records in a an IDM environment
- provision_via_satellite: provision compute via Red Hat Satellite
- add_vmdk: add virtual disks to a VM in a VMware environment

Consult the role's READMEs for more information on what the role expects for input
